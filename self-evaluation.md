# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

    - The challenges went smoother than I thought! I'm confident now but know it'll get more complicated.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

    - unproductively struggled until I watched my small group's posted videos and was able to ask them questions.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

    - I need to get better at google things. I think pushing more practice for the mornings before the zoom session and less work at night is a good idea.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

    - I still need to figure out how to square each number in an array and planning on asking my sm. group if I haven't found the answer after 10mins.
